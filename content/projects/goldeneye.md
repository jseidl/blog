GoldenEye GoldenEye is a <acronym title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym>/S Layer 7 Denial-of-Service Testing Tool. It uses KeepAlive (and Connection: keep-alive) paired with Cache-Control options to persist socket connection busting through caching (when possible) until it consumes all available sockets on the <acronym title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym>/S server.

This project started by the influence of [Barry Shteiman][1] who created [HULK][2], a Proof-of-concept tool that I decided to improve which later became GoldenEye. Kudos for you Barry!

This software is written in purely Python.

_* Some users reports that GoldenEye is also running 100% stable on Mac&#8217;s and Windows&#8217;s python._
