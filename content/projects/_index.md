## Here are some tools that I&#8217;ve developed.



  * [VirtuaPlant][1]: A Virtual Industrial Plant simulator with a soft-PLC to help demonstrate and understand the real-world impacts on attacks on control systems.
  * [GoldenEye][2]: This a layer 7 denial-of-service tool created as expansion of the Hulk project by [Barry Shteiman][3]. It&#8217;s written in python and uses KeepAlive+NoCache directives to conduct slow <acronym title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> attacks on webservers.
  * [GoldenEye 4 Android][4]: Java port of the GoldenEye tool for Android. Not available at Google Play store. APK available from F-Droid.
  * [usernamer][5]: usernamer is a penetration testing tool to generate a list of possible usernames/logins for determined name (ex: John Doe Doeson) for user enumeration or bruteforcing. This tool also supports text-files with one name per line as input.
  * [<acronym title="The Onion Router">TOR</acronym>-Block][6]: TORBlock is a BASH script to automatically download the list of <acronym title="The Onion Router">TOR</acronym> exit-nodes and add them to your IPTables ruleset.
  * [Multi-<acronym title="The Onion Router">TOR</acronym>][7]: Multi-<acronym title="The Onion Router">TOR</acronym> is a shellscript to open multiple <acronym title="The Onion Router">TOR</acronym> instances each one with a different identity (<acronym title="Internet Protocol">IP</acronym> address) and bound to a specific socket.
