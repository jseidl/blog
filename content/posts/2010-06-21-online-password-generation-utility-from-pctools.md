Here&#8217;s a [good online password generator][1] from [PcTools][2] that generates passwords based on various parameters such as password length; letters, numbers, special characters inclusion; hability to exclude similar characters etc.

Good to have bookmarked! There&#8217;s also desktop version (Windows) of the password generator in the &#8220;Password Utilities&#8221; software provided by PcTools.
