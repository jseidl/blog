These past weeks I&#8217;ve been following the US drone hijacking by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.

Recently the [details of the hacking][1] were posted. 

The IRG says the communication signals were jammed forcing the <acronym title="Unmanned Aerial Vehicle">UAV</acronym> to go into autopilot (RTL &#8211; Return To Land, to be more precise). Then the GPS signals were spoofed to make the drone think that Iran Base was his Base.

[US experts are still questioning these claims][2]. 

Truth or not it is very interesting.
