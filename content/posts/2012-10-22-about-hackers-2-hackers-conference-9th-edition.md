Hi Folks,

This last weekend was my talk on Hackers 2 Hackers Conference 9th Edition @ SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The talk was in portuguese and the slides are available [here][1] (download pdf) and [here][2] (slideshare).

The subject of the talk was about layer 7 denial of service techniques and tools, using haproxy and socat to create a distributed denial of service from a single node, some XSS payload for <acronym title="Distributed Denial-of-Service">DDoS</acronym> and demonstration of the GoldenEye Mobile tool released today.

I am very happy with the results, with the public&#8217;s acceptance and reaction to the material presented and for the cheers from all the good friends and IT professionals from Brazil.

Also, thanks to [Utah Networks][3], the talk was live streamed and recorded and the video can be found on this link or below.

[TI Safe][4], the company that I currently work at, has also published some photos at [their Flickr page][5].

As I promised to the attendees, the code for [GoldenEye][6] and [GoldenEye Mobile][7] are available at [my github page][8].

Below a demo video of the GoldenEye Mobile tool in a test:

Talk apart, the whole event was AWESOME as usual. Spectacular specially crafted beer, excellent coffee-break, excellent service, excellent infrastructure! Hackers 2 Hackers Conference once again proved why is one of the most incredible confs at Brazil.

Thanks for people at H2HC for accepting the paper and doing such a great event.
