Hi folks! I&#8217;m glad to inform that my paper &#8220;Advanced <acronym title="Distributed Denial-of-Service">DDoS</acronym> techniques: Layer 7, load-balancing and mobile tools&#8221; was accepted by the [9th Hackers 2 Hackers Conference (H2HC)][1].

The event will take place on October 20-21 and it seems to be another success just like previous editions.

Don&#8217;t forget to check the event&#8217;s website for full line-up. If you can, enroll and enjoy!
